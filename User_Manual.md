Once this is done, we land on our [Home Dashboard](https://github.com/jefferns/CS5001/wiki/User-Manual-Home-Page#home-dashboard)

# Home Dashboard
The Dashboard is where you facilitate the types of songs that will be recommended. Select **up to 5** songs or artists before advancing and generating a set of new recommendations. To learn more about adding seeds, checkout [Seeding](https://github.com/jefferns/CS5001/wiki/User-Manual-Home-Page#seeding). These steps will be required before accessing the [Music Player](https://github.com/jefferns/CS5001/wiki/User-Manual-Home-Page#player)
 
## Seeding
 Seeds are used to determine the songs returned as recommendations. They can be used to mix genres, sounds, vibes, and help curate the creation of a great new playlist. To begin, select one of the four seeding options.
### Seeding Options
There are 4 Seeding options:
- Songs
- Artists
- Your Top Songs
- Your Top Artists

`Songs` and `Artists` act similarly. They give the user a choice of any songs or artists they wish to combine. 
With these selected, click the `+` to allow for the addition of a new seed. 

<p align="center">

</p>

After this, the user is prompted to type the name of the desired song or artist. Execute the search with a press of `Enter`. 

The user is then provided with a `Drop Down` containing all the songs or artists returned by their search. Click one to add it to the `Seeds`.

## Recommendations
The Recommendations are a list of songs Spotify believes you will enjoy based on your given [Seeds](https://github.com/jefferns/CS5001/wiki/User-Manual-Home-Page#seeding).
These can be retrieved by clicking the `Get Recommendations` button. Note, there must be at least one seed present in order to retrieve the Recommendations.

The Recommendations will appear in a separate list to the right side of the screen.

</p>

Once Recommendations are generated, we can click the `Let's Go' button and start listening to our new songs!


# Music Player
Immediately, the user can start listening to the specially curated songs. Short previews of each [Recommendation](https://github.com/jefferns/CS5001/wiki/User-Manual-Home-Page#recommendations) will play. Based on the User's preferences, they can "swipe" left or right on each song. 
- Swipe Left:
  - Click and hold on the Album Art, then drag left into the <b>Red</b> area.
  - This will Skip the current song, and play the next
- Swipe Right:
  - Click and hold on the Album Art, then drag right into the <b>Green</b> area.
  - This will add the song to your [Matches](https://github.com/jefferns/CS5001/wiki/User-Manual-Home-Page#matches), so you can save it for later
The Player also provides the user with some controls. They are able to adjust Volume as they wish. They can also scrub back and forth throughout a song. The user can also play/pause and adjust playback speed. 
## Matches
When a user `swipes right` on a [Recommendation](https://github.com/jefferns/CS5001/wiki/User-Manual-Home-Page#recommendations), the song is added to their `Matches`, their future playlist in the making. 

After the user has accumulated as many Matches as they wish, they can click the `Export Playlist` button. This will then <b>automatically create a playlist on their Spotify account </b> containing all the matches.
