# Project Ideas
I have not found a project idea I am ready to commit to. I am thinking I want to pursue some kind of website or web software. These are the skills I want to develop the most. Some of the things I was considering was developing a site that displays some kind of sports team statistics in an easy to consume. Another idea I’ve had include building an app incorporating Spotify’s API. I would also be interested in developing some kind of game, albeit I have no experience on mobile apps. That would be an interesting path to learn though. I have worked on projects in the past, but have never used Unity, only Godot.
